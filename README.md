## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Rick and Morty character search web application backed by the official Rick and Morty graphql endpoint (https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql). The application allows users to explore a comprehensive list of characters from the Rick and Morty series. Each character is presented in a user-friendly format, displaying their essential details such as name, species, origin, location, and status. The application has been built using Nextjs + TypeScript, ensuring a robust and type-safe codebase. Additionally, I have utilized Yarn as the package manager and Material-UI (MUI) for creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface. To enhance the application's state management, I have incorporated Redux, a popular state management library in the React ecosystem. This choice ensures efficient handling of state changes, providing a seamless user experience.For authentication I've used clerk. And lastly, I've integrated openAPI to generate character information wich is not available in the official Rick and Morty graphql endpoint.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Sigup and create account on these to get APIs needed to run the app:
1. https://clerk.com/
2. https://openai.com/

Use these env template and just update the missing keys with the values you will get from above accouts:

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<GET_ME_FROM_CLERK>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<GET_ME_FROM_CLERK>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<GET_ME_FROM_OPENAI>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
GRAPHQL_URL=https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql/
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
